# Philosophical Ideas and Who are Behind It

## [Hardvard's Justice Course by Michael Sandel](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+ER22.1x+2T2019/course/)

This course is an introduction to moral and political philosophy. It explores classical and contemporary theories of justice, and applies these theories to contemporary legal and political controversies. Topics include affirmative action, income distribution, same-sex marriage, the role of markets, debates about rights (human rights and property rights), arguments for and against equality, and dilemmas of loyalty in public and private life. The course invites students to subject their own views on those controversies to critical examination. The principal readings are texts by Aristotle, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls. We also read some contemporary court cases and articles about political issues that raise philosophical questions.

>Society needs equal starting point for all, but govt subsidising education will not serve the purpose because its not a efficient system, subsidized education is not a proper system as it lacks the effort of officials who are giving it. For the low income people, they will be credited the education cost, which they need to give back in some way. there comes another issue of debt cycle. the debt for education shouldn't burden students life. A proper system is necessary for education. 

> Another way to think is what form of education should be subsidised?
